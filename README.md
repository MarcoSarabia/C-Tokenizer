Lab Project: Building a Tokenizer
===================================

# Description
This project is a demonstration of a `Tokenizer` that maintains history, implemented as part of a Computer Science course. 

Tokenizing is the process of dividing a string into tokens by some delimeter (e.g. the string libraries split() function). Consider tokenizing the string “The cake is a lie!” using the space
character. This would result in: \[“The”, “cake”, “is”, “a”, “lie!”\].

This tokenizer maintains a history. A good example of this
is the bash command, **history**; or, something similar to below:

1.  The cake is a lie!
2.  But it was delicious.
3.  True.

The project was originally outlined by Dr. Eric Freudenthal as part of the curriculum for CS 3320 Intro to Computer Architecture at The University of Texas at El Paso.

A related demo program is in directory "sortArgDemo".
